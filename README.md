# Nextcloud-Bookmarks
Searchable and collapsible display of browser bookmarks exported from Nextcloud

## Background
I self-host a personal wiki which I use as a private repository of notes, to-dos, and other info. As a matter of curiosity, I wanted to make my brower bookmarks available in this wiki - beyond the basic "export as html" capability. I envisioned a collapsible tree, that was also searchable. My browser bookmarks are synced to an external Nextcloud service via the Floccus extension, and that Nextcloud service exposes the [bookmarks API](https://nextcloud-bookmarks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for querying.
